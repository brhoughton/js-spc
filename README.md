# Stone, Parchment, Cutter

The greatest game ever made!

## Description

As part of the back-to-basics vibe I've had this week, I wanted build a game; something I've actually never done before. This was the type of project that I noticed a lot of people making years ago as they learned JS, but it wasn't something I did.

So, here is Stone, Parchment, Cutter! The greatest game to ever made. ðŸŽ®
